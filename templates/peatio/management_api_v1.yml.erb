# Keep all the API security scopes.
#
# The API security scope consists of scope name, list of permitted and mandatory signers.
# The scope name is associated with API actions. For example, write_deposits is associated with
# ability to create deposits and accept them. The scopes which have «write» in the name are supposed
# to be dangerous so they must require more signatures then read-only scopes
#
# Each scope must include list of permitted and mandatory signers.
# Peatio validates JWT signatures against permitted keys and doesn't trust
# JWTs which don't include signatures from all mandatory signers.
#
